# Code involving string concatenation
If the code is creating two new strings (ans and s) in a loop, which involves string concatenation. 
String concatenation in a loop can be inefficient because, in Java, strings are immutable.
Each time you concatenate a string, a new string object is created. 
This can lead to a significant amount of memory allocation and copying, especially in a loop.
